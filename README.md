# Remaining-Time
In this constantly evolving age of technology, smartphoneâ€™s have become an indispensable component of an individual's lifestyle. People use it for various purposes from streaming media to navigating different places, phones come in handy everywhere. To keep this fascinating piece of tech going on throughout the day it derives its power from the factory fitted batteries. This makes it one of the key components of a phone. Initially increasing the battery capacity was considered to be the only solution to increasing battery life but as scientific advancements happened battery optimization eventually replaced it as the best solution because increase in battery size clashed with design constraints, but optimized battery means a smaller and efficient battery could be fitted into compact form factors. Battery optimization has now become a field of research. This project is a small step in that direction. Battery life of a smartphone is dependent on various factors like battery voltage, temperature etc. Through this project we are trying to predict the remaining time period for which a smartphone can be used based upon the current battery percentage.
